The dev cloud environment tests single node deployments in a multi-node environment.
Each machine is configured in the same way to compare functionality, performance,
and failure. The idea, in part, is to practice with a multi-node environment. Later
environments are multi-node.

Ansible is used to manage all the nodes in the deployment, including
the process of releasing the applications, including the following:

1. cloning repositories from github
2. checking out specified version
3. run with nodejs
4. build docker container

Nodes in the dev environment also execute Jenkins. Jenkins is used for
Continuous integration to ensure the dev branch of every reporitory is healthy.
Healthy means it passes a build, postman tests (if applicable), and deploys on
the dev server.

All of this can be stopped with the following command:

  sudo service jenkins stop
