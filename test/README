The test cloud environment is a multi-node deployment across 3 servers.
The servers are aliased as test1, test2, test3. These aliases are used to
install the web app, services, and database in there respective nodes

1. test1: app
2. test2: service
3. test3: database

Ansible is used to ensure each node has the same basic configuration and then
used to deploy the correct software to each node.
